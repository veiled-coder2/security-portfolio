# Week 6 – Metabase ECS + RDS Deployment  

🎯 **Objective**  
Deploy **Metabase** on **Amazon ECS** using the **Fargate** launch type and connect it to a **PostgreSQL** database hosted on **Amazon RDS**.  
Use the official Docker image `metabase/metabase`, configure environment variables for DB connectivity, and ensure both ECS and RDS are in the same **VPC**.  
Allow inbound traffic on **port 5432** from ECS to RDS for database communication.  

📦 **Deliverables (Screenshots)**  
- 🏷️ RDS PostgreSQL instance details (endpoint + status)  
- 🔢 ECS Task Definition using `metabase/metabase` image and environment variables  
- 🛡️ Security Group rules allowing inbound **5432** from ECS SG  
- 🌐 Metabase setup screen showing successful database connection  

✅ **Completion Summary**  
- Created RDS PostgreSQL instance in same VPC as ECS  
- Configured Security Groups to allow ECS → RDS on TCP 5432  
- Defined ECS Task with `metabase/metabase` Docker image and env variables for RDS connection  
- Launched Fargate Service and verified task status = **RUNNING**  
- Connected Metabase to RDS and confirmed successful setup 🎉

🧭 **Steps (Brief)**  
1. Create RDS PostgreSQL → note endpoint & credentials  
2. Create ECS Cluster (Fargate launch type)  
3. Define Task → Container Image: `metabase/metabase` → Add DB env variables  
4. Create Service → Attach ECS Security Group + place in same VPC as RDS  
5. Configure RDS SG → Inbound TCP 5432 from ECS SG  
6. Launch Service → Open Metabase UI → Enter DB details → Verify success  

🔒 **Security Notes**  
- Restrict port 5432 access to only ECS Security Group (no public exposure)  
- Store credentials in AWS Secrets Manager for production  
- Enable CloudWatch logging to monitor task and DB connectivity  

🧪 **Validation**  
- RDS instance status = Available ✅  
- ECS Task status = Running ✅  
- Security Group rules correct ✅  
- Metabase connected successfully and dashboard loaded 🚀
