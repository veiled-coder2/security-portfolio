# üñ•Ô∏è DDoS Incident Report ‚Äì NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

## **1. Summary**

A multimedia company experienced a **DDoS attack** flooding ICMP packets into the network, causing internal services to stop for two hours.  
The attack exploited an unconfigured firewall. Mitigation included blocking ICMP traffic, restoring critical services, and implementing firewall rules, IP verification, monitoring, and IDS/IPS filtering.

## **3. Reflections / Notes**

- The incident reinforced the importance of **proactive network monitoring**.
- Misconfigured firewalls are **common vulnerabilities**‚Äîregular audits are essential.
- Implementing **NIST CSF systematically** improves visibility, response times, and overall security posture.
- Lessons learned can feed into **SOC playbooks and future DDoS mitigation strategies**.
