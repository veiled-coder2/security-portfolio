# ☁️ Cloud Application Security Portfolio  

> ✨ *Not just exploring security — building it into every layer of the cloud.* ✨  

Welcome to my **Cloud Application Security Portfolio**,  
a growing collection of hands-on projects that bring together my passion for **Application Security**, **Cloud Security**, and **DevSecOps Automation**.  

This space showcases my journey toward mastering how applications are **built, deployed, and secured** in the cloud. 🌍  

---

## 🧭 Focus Areas  

- ☁️ **Cloud Security (OCI & AWS)** — designing and securing workloads in multi-cloud environments.  
- 🧩 **Application Security (AppSec)** — protecting APIs, securing code, and preventing vulnerabilities before deployment.  
- ⚙️ **DevSecOps Automation** — integrating security into CI/CD pipelines using tools like **Snyk**, **Trivy**, and **OWASP ZAP**.  
- 📊 **Monitoring & Detection** — visualizing threats using **Cloud Guard**, **CloudWatch**, and **Splunk** dashboards.  
- 📜 **Compliance & Governance** — Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) and Policy-as-Code (OPA) for cloud standards.
